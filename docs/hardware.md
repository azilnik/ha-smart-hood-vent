# Hardware Guide

You need three things: a temperature sensor, something to press your hood's button, and a Zigbee coordinator (if you don't already have one).

## Temperature & Humidity Sensor

This is the "eyes" of the automation — it detects cooking activity by measuring how fast the air is heating up.

      <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/THIRDREALITY-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor-Lite/dp/B0F6CKHHDV">Third Reality Zigbee Temperature & Humidity Sensor Lite</a></strong><br/>
      Reports temperature and humidity over Zigbee. Compact, battery-powered, easy to mount near the stove. Same accuracy as the full-size model at a lower price — you don't need the LCD screen for this automation.<br/>
      <strong>~$15</strong>

| Sensor | Notes | Price |
|--------|-------|-------|
| [Third Reality Sensor (with LCD)](https://www.amazon.com/THIRDREALITY-Zigbee-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor/dp/B0BN32XX24) | Same sensor with a small LCD screen for at-a-glance readings | ~$20 |
| [SONOFF SNZB-02](https://www.amazon.com/SONOFF-SNZB-02-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor/dp/B08BCHRH1P) | Very compact, wide HA support | ~$12 |

Any Zigbee temperature sensor that reports to HA will work. The key is frequent reporting intervals (ideally every 30–60 seconds).

## Hood Control (SwitchBot)

Unless your hood vent is already wired into a smart switch, you need a physical way to press the button. A SwitchBot Bot is a tiny robotic arm that mounts over your existing hood button and presses it on command.

      <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-switch-button-controlled-compatible/dp/B07B7NXV4R">SwitchBot Bot</a></strong><br/>
      A tiny motorized arm that physically presses buttons. Sticks onto your hood with adhesive — no wiring, no modification to your hood.<br/>
      <strong>~$30</strong>

    <td>
      <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Thermometer-Hygrometer-Bluetooth-Temperature/dp/B07TTH451R">SwitchBot Hub Mini</a></strong><br/>
      The Bot communicates over Bluetooth, but the Hub bridges it to your Wi-Fi network so Home Assistant can control it. You need one Hub for all your SwitchBot devices.<br/>
      <strong>~$40</strong><br/><br/>

<summary><strong>Alternative hood controls</strong></summary>
<br/>

If your hood is hardwired (i.e., it's controlled by a wall switch rather than a button on the hood itself), you can use a smart relay instead:

| Device | Notes | Price |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Any Zigbee smart switch | Replaces your wall switch entirely | $15–30 |
| [Shelly Plus 1](https://www.shelly.com/en/products/shop/shelly-plus-1) | Wi-Fi relay, wires behind the switch | ~$12 |

</details>

## Zigbee Coordinator

This is the "radio" that lets Home Assistant talk to your Zigbee sensor. If you already use Zigbee devices with HA, you already have one — skip this.

      <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SMLIGHT-SLZB-06-Coordinator-Zigbee2MQTT-Assistant/dp/B0BL6DQSB3">SMLIGHT SLZB-06</a></strong><br/>
      Connects over Ethernet, USB, or Wi-Fi. Supports PoE. Can be placed anywhere in your house for best Zigbee coverage — doesn't need to be plugged into the HA server directly.<br/>
      <strong>~$45</strong>

| Coordinator | Notes | Price |

## Prerequisites

If any of these are new to you, here are some helpful starting points:

### Home Assistant

- [What is Home Assistant?](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/) — 5-minute overview
- [Installation guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) — pick your hardware and follow the steps
- [Onboarding walkthrough](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/onboarding/) — first-time setup
- [Concepts & terminology](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/concepts-terminology/) — entities, automations, integrations

> **Recommended hardware for beginners:** A [Raspberry Pi 4 (4 GB)](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi) or an [Intel NUC / mini PC](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/generic-x86-64) running Home Assistant OS.

### Zigbee

- [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/getting-started/) — alternative with more advanced device support

### YAML Basics

You'll need to copy files and add 3 lines to `secrets.yaml`. No need to write YAML from scratch.

- [HA's YAML intro](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/yaml/) — syntax basics
